# VCS Diff - Show Pending Changes

Display all current changes that are pending to be committed, with an intelligent summary of what the changes mean for your project.

**Usage**: `/vcs/diff`

## Implementation

Show all changes in the working directory and staging area with a meaningful summary for non-developer users. This command analyzes changes and explains their impact in plain language.

Steps to execute:
1. Check if we're in a git repository
2. Run `git status --porcelain` to get an overview of changed files
3. Run `git diff` and `git diff --cached` to analyze actual changes
4. Analyze the changes to understand:
   - What type of work is being done (new features, bug fixes, configuration changes, etc.)
   - Which parts of the project are affected
   - The scope and impact of the changes
5. Present a user-friendly summary with proper formatting including:
   - **Project Impact Summary**: What these changes mean for the project in plain language
   - **Work Summary**: What kind of work has been done
   - **Files Affected**: List of changed files with brief explanations
   - **Readiness Assessment**: Whether changes are ready to be saved
6. Avoid technical jargon and focus on the practical meaning of changes
7. Ensure proper line breaks and spacing between all sections for readability
8. Use clear visual separators (like `---`) between major sections
9. Format output with consistent spacing and clear section headers

## Examples

```bash
/vcs/diff
```

This will show:
- **"You've been working on..."** - A summary of what the changes accomplish
- **"These changes affect..."** - Which parts of your project are impacted  
- **"Ready to save?"** - Whether the changes form a complete unit of work
- Clear, non-technical explanations of what each file change does

Example output:
```
